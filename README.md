# goxsd

Goxsd is a tool for generating XML decoding Go structs from an [XSD schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1) specification. It does not yet implement the full XSD specificaiton, but goes sufficiently far to be useful for at least some use cases.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/ivarg/goxsd
```

## Usage

goxsd will default its output to stdout if an output file name is not given. Apart from a destination file, goxsd also accepts an export flag to toggle generation of exported struct names on (default is to generate unexported structs), and a prefix to be prepended to each struct name.

Any import statement in the XSD will be parsed and followed, interpreting the path as relative to the current XSD file.

```
Usage: goxsd [options] <xsd_file>

Options:
  -o <file>     Destination file [default: stdout]
  -p <package>  Package name [default: goxsd]
  -e            Generate exported structs [default: false]
  -x <prefix>   Struct name prefix [default: ""]

goxsd is a tool for generating XML decoding/encoding Go structs, according
to an XSD schema.
```

## TODOs

* Complete handling of more XSD elements is needed

* XSD namespaces are currently completely ignored, opening for undefined behavior if two namespaces are parsed with conflicting element- or type names.

* At some point, I would also like to generate validation code, that could check various rules and constraints expressed in the XSD

## clone 说明
这个项目处理逻辑比较简单，但是只能应付很简单的xml类型。
使用template进行模板渲染
无法处理根目录下是简单类型的template,比如以下的xml元素无法处理
```
<xs:element name="GBSeqid" type="xs:string"/>

<xs:element name="GBSecondary-accn" type="xs:string"/>

<xs:element name="GBKeyword" type="xs:string"/>

```
